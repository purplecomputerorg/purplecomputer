# Purple Computer

**Give them a first computer you can feel good about.**

Transform your old laptop into a calm space for open-ended play. No internet, no apps. Designed for 4–7 and fun for 2–8+.
They explore, create, and put it down on their own.

## What Is Purple?

Purple Computer turns your old laptop into a calm, creative computer for kids. When you turn it on, it starts straight into Purple. There's no desktop and no other apps.

- **Building, not consuming.** Words, colors, sounds, and numbers to play with.
- **Nothing to break.** The whole laptop is Purple. No apps, no internet, nothing to mess up.
- **A screen they walk away from.** No tantrums, no parental controls needed.
- **Pay once, use on every laptop.** Works on every laptop you own, now or later.

## Quick Start

### For Development (Linux only)

Purple Computer requires Linux with evdev for keyboard input. macOS is not supported. Use a Linux VM if developing on Mac (see `guides/linux-vm-dev-setup.md`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/purplecomputerorg/purplecomputer.git
cd purplecomputer
make setup    # Creates venv, installs deps, downloads TTS voice, installs fonts
make run      # Launches in Alacritty with Purple theme
```

Inside Purple Computer, try:
```
2 + 2                  # Math with dot visualization
3 * 4 + 2              # Operator precedence (= 14)
cat * 5                # Five cats
dog + cat              # Emoji addition (🐶 🐱)
3 + 4 + 2 bananas      # Numbers attach to emoji (= 9 bananas)
red + blue             # Color mixing (= purple)
purple truck           # Color swatch + emoji in free text
I love cat!            # Speaks "I love cat" aloud (! triggers speech)
```

### For Installation (Old Laptop)

**Build and test installer:**
```bash
cd build-scripts

# Build everything (20-35 min first time, 15-25 min subsequent)
./build-in-docker.sh

# Validate build (checks configs, verifies artifacts)
./validate-build.sh

# Result: /opt/purple-installer/output/purple-installer-YYYYMMDD.iso
```

**Flash to USB:**
```bash
# List USB drives and find your drive's serial number
./build-scripts/flash-to-usb.sh --list

# Add your drive's serial to the whitelist (one-time setup)
echo 'YOUR_DRIVE_SERIAL' >> .flash-drives.conf

# Flash the latest ISO (with verification)
./build-scripts/flash-to-usb.sh
```

**Install to hardware:**
1. Boot laptop from USB (Secure Boot can remain enabled)
2. Installation runs automatically (10-20 minutes)
3. System reboots into Purple Computer

The system logs in automatically as the `purple` user (no password needed).

See [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) for complete build/customization details.

## The Three Modes

Purple has three core modes:

| Key | Mode | What It Does |
|-----|------|--------------|
| **F1** | **Explore** | Type a word, see an emoji, hear it spoken, mix colors, do math. Kids who can read get the most out of this, but even pre-readers can use it with just numbers (2 + 3). See [guides/explore-mode-design.md](guides/explore-mode-design.md) |
| **F2** | **Play** | Make music and draw with the keyboard. Press any key to play a sound and paint a color. Even a 2-year-old can have fun here. |
| **F3** | **Doodle** | Write and paint with colors that mix like real paint. Great around 3-4+. |

**Controls:**
- **Escape (tap):** Mode picker (Explore, Play, Doodle)
- **F1-F3:** Switch modes directly
- **F9:** Toggle dark/light theme
- **F10:** Mute/unmute, **F11:** Volume down, **F12:** Volume up
- **Caps Lock:** Toggle big/small letters
- **Ctrl+V:** Cycle views (Screen → Line → Ears)
- **Tab** (in Doodle): Toggle write/paint mode
- **Hold Escape (1s):** Parent mode (admin menu)

**Speech** (in Explore mode): Add `!` anywhere (e.g., `cat!`) or use `say`/`talk` prefix to hear results spoken aloud.

## Keyboard Features

Purple includes a hardware keyboard normalizer that makes typing easier for kids:

### Easy Capitals (No Shift Key Needed)
- **Double-tap any key** — Types the shifted version (`a` `a` → `A`, `1` `1` → `!`)
- **Tap Shift quickly** — Activates "sticky shift" for the next character
- **Hold Shift + type** — Normal shift behavior (uppercase while held)

Kids can type capital letters without holding two keys at once!

### Parent Mode
- **Hold Escape for 1 second** — Opens parent menu (display settings, volume, updates)

### F-Key Setup

On first boot, Purple automatically runs keyboard setup. You'll be asked to press F1 through F12. This captures each key's scancode, making F-keys work regardless of the laptop's default behavior (some laptops send brightness/volume instead of F1-F12).

### How It Works

**Purple Computer requires Linux with evdev.** macOS is not supported.

Keyboard input is read directly from evdev, bypassing the terminal. The terminal (Alacritty) is display-only. This gives us:
- True key down/up events for reliable timing
- Space-hold detection for paint mode
- All keycodes (terminals drop some F-keys)

The keyboard handling:
- Grabs the hardware keyboard exclusively (kiosk mode)
- Remaps physical F-keys via scancodes (survives Fn Lock changes)
- Detects sticky shift, double-tap, and Escape long-press
- Processes events through a state machine that emits high-level actions

See `guides/keyboard-architecture.md` for technical details.

## Screen Size

Purple Computer displays a **112×32 character viewport** (plus header and footer) that fills **80% of the screen**. Font size is automatically calculated to fit, clamped to 12-48pt. On typical old laptops (11-15"), this fills most of the screen with a visible purple border.

**Minimum supported resolution:** 1024×768

**Stack:**
- **Target System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS minimal + X11 + Alacritty + Textual TUI
- **Installer:** Remastered Ubuntu Server ISO with initramfs hook, Secure Boot support
- **Application:** Python + Textual + Piper TTS + Pygame

**How Installation Works:**

There are **two separate systems** involved:

1. **USB Installer** (temporary): A remastered Ubuntu Server ISO with a two-gate safety model.
   - **Gate 1 (initramfs):** Checks for `purple.install=1` in kernel cmdline, writes runtime artifacts to `/run/`
   - **Gate 2 (userspace):** Shows confirmation screen, requires user to press ENTER
   - Ubuntu's boot stack (shim, GRUB, kernel) and squashfs are untouched

2. **Installed System** (permanent): A pre-built Ubuntu 24.04 image created with debootstrap. This is what kids actually use.

The USB's only job is to copy the pre-built image to disk (after user confirmation). After reboot, the USB is never used again.

**Why this design:**
- Ubuntu's signed boot chain → Secure Boot works
- Ubuntu's stock kernel → all hardware drivers included
- No package installation during setup → fast, reliable, offline
- Standard Ubuntu on the installed system → normal apt updates work
- Initramfs hook writes to `/run/` → squashfs never modified
- Two-gate safety → explicit user consent before disk writes

See [guides/architecture-overview.md](guides/architecture-overview.md) for a detailed explanation of why this design exists and what alternatives we tried.

## Philosophy

**Computers are a big part of their future.** Purple lets them start the way we did: open-ended play, making things, figuring it out.

- Their own computer, a real computer they use and put away on their own
- Building and creating, not watching and swiping
- No Wi-Fi, no browser, no way to connect to the internet
- Your old laptop still works. To your kid, it's a hand-me-down from a legend
