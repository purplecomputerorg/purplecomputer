**A joyful, kid-safe creativity computer built from your old laptop.**

Purple Computer is a calm, distraction-free computing environment for kids ages 3-8. It transforms old laptops into magical creativity machines where every keystroke brings wonder and mistakes are impossible.

## The Vision

Purple Computer is a creativity device, not an entertainment device. Kids write, draw, explore, type, and imagine—slowly and calmly. There are no videos, no ads, no app stores, no infinite feeds, no accounts, no tracking, no social media, and no algorithms.

**Screen time that feels like quiet time.**

For screen-skeptical parents: a computer kids can't break, and parents don't have to fight with.

## Sustainability

**Every Purple Laptop saves a device from the landfill.**

Purple Computer runs on 2010-2020 era laptops—ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, HP EliteBooks, Surfaces, MacBook Airs. These machines have years of life left but often sit in drawers or head to e-waste. Purple gives them new purpose as dedicated creativity tools for kids, extending their lifespan by 5-10 more years.

Minimal requirements: 2GB RAM, 20GB storage, x86_64 processor. Old hardware runs it beautifully.

## The Four Modes

Purple Computer organizes around four simple modes, accessed by function keys:

### F1: Ask
A math and emoji playground. Type `2 + 2` and see `4`. Type `cat` and see 🐱. Type `cat + dog` and see 🐱🐶. Type `3 * rainbow` and see 🌈🌈🌈. Mix colors: `red + blue` shows purple. Every word becomes an opportunity for delight.

### F2: Play
A music and art grid mapped to the keyboard. Press any letter to play a note and paint a color. The full QWERTY keyboard becomes an instrument—ten keys across, four rows down. No wrong notes, just exploration.

### F3: Listen
A library of stories and songs (coming soon). Kid-friendly audio content, no streaming required.

### F4: Write
A simple text editor with large, friendly text. Sticky shift makes capitals easy. Typing from different keyboard rows mixes colors like paint—top row adds red, middle adds blue, bottom adds yellow.

## Key Design Principles

- **No files to delete, no settings to break, no internet to worry about**
- **No login required**—boots straight into the purple interface
- **Offline by default**—works without network access
- **One-handed typing friendly**—sticky shift and long-press for symbols
- **Parent mode** (hold Escape)—password-protected admin access

## Getting a Purple Computer

Purple Computer is designed to be dead simple for non-technical parents. Two paths:

### Option 1: DIY Installation
If you have an old laptop lying around:
1. Download the Purple Computer USB installer
2. Boot from USB and follow the simple installation
3. Hand it to your little one

The installer handles everything—no terminal commands, no configuration, no technical knowledge required. It transforms any compatible laptop into a dedicated Purple Computer that boots directly into the purple interface.

### Option 2: Buy a Ready-to-Go Purple Laptop
Don't have a spare laptop or don't want to deal with installation? Pre-configured Purple Laptops are available for purchase—refurbished machines with Purple Computer already installed. Power on and it just works.

These are quality used laptops (ThinkPads, etc.) that have been tested, cleaned, and set up with Purple Computer. They arrive ready for a kid to start exploring immediately.

## Technology

Purple Computer is a custom Linux-based operating system built on Ubuntu. The interface is a fullscreen terminal application with:

- Large, kid-appropriate text sizing
- Text-to-speech for typed content
- Custom keyboard handling for young typists
- Thoughtful power management (auto-sleep, safe shutdown)
- Trackpad/mouse disabled—keyboard only

The entire experience fits in a 100×28 character viewport, targeting roughly 10×6 inches of physical screen space regardless of the laptop's actual size.

## Content Packs

Purple uses a modular content pack system. Packs contain emojis, sounds, and definitions—no executable code. The core pack includes 100+ emojis with kid-friendly short names.

## Who It's For

- **Kids ages 3-8** who are ready for screen time that sparks creativity
- **Parents** who want safe, calm, educational screen time
- **Families** with old laptops gathering dust
- **Anyone** who believes computing can be joyful, accessible, and magical
