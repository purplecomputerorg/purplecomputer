# Purple Computer: Parent Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you understand and manage Purple Computer for your child.

## What is This?

Purple Computer is a real computer for kids ages 3-8. They type commands on a keyboard and see what happens.

It's text-based. They type, the computer responds.

## What to Expect

When your child sits down at Purple Computer, they'll see:
- A **big purple screen** with large, friendly text
- A **welcome message** that says hello
- A **prompt** where they can start typing

That's it! No desktop, no icons, no apps.

## What Your Child Can Do

### Type and Hear
Anything your child types can be read aloud. The computer has a pleasant voice that speaks back to them.

### Play with Words and Emojis
Simple words like "cat", "dog", "star", and "heart" turn into emoji pictures. Your child can combine them and see patterns.

### Switch Between Modes
Your child can try different modes:
- **Speech Mode**: The computer reads everything aloud
- **Emoji Mode**: Words become pictures
- **Math Mode**: Simple counting and patterns
- **Rainbow Mode**: Colorful text output
- **Surprise Mode**: Random fun things happen

### Big Letter Mode
When your child presses the **Caps Lock** key, Purple Computer automatically switches to **Big Letter Mode**:
- Everything they type appears in BIG UPPERCASE LETTERS
- The computer's responses also come back in BIG LETTERS
- The screen shows "🔠 BIG LETTERS ON" when they turn it on
- The screen shows "🔡 big letters off" when they turn it off

This is especially helpful for young kids (ages 3-5) who are still learning to recognize letters. Uppercase letters are often easier for beginning readers to identify and distinguish.

## Is It Safe?

**Yes.** Purple Computer is designed to be completely safe:

- ✅ Your child can't access the internet
- ✅ Your child can't delete files or break things
- ✅ Your child can't install anything
- ✅ Your child can't see or change system settings
- ✅ The computer won't freeze or crash from kid input

Your child can type anything, press any keys (except the parent escape—see below), and nothing bad will happen.

## How to Exit (Parent Escape)

To exit Purple Computer and access the system as a parent:

**Press: Ctrl + Alt + P**

Hold down all three keys at once:
- `Ctrl` (Control key)
- `Alt` (Alternate key)
- `P` (the letter P)

This will:
1. Pause Purple Computer
2. Show a simple parent menu
3. Let you choose to:
   - Return to Purple Computer
   - Open a regular terminal
   - Shut down the computer
   - Restart the computer

**Your child is unlikely to discover this by accident**, as they'd need to press all three keys simultaneously and know to use the letter P.

## Common Questions

### The computer is speaking too much/too little
Use the parent escape (Ctrl+Alt+P) to access settings.

### How do I turn it off?
Use the parent escape (Ctrl+Alt+P) and choose "Shut down" from the menu.

### Can I install other software?
Purple Computer is designed to be a dedicated kid environment. If you want to install other software, you'll need to use the parent escape to access a regular terminal, but this changes the safe, simple experience for your child.

### What if my child wants to do more?
Purple Computer is a first step. By ages 8-10, most kids are ready for Scratch, Python tutorials, or a regular desktop. They'll have keyboard skills and computing confidence to build on.

### Is there internet access?
By default, no. Purple Computer works completely offline. You can enable internet via the parent terminal if needed, but it's not accessible from the kid environment.

## Troubleshooting

### The computer won't boot into Purple Computer
1. Make sure the installation completed successfully
2. Try restarting the computer
3. Check the autoinstall logs (see [autoinstall.md](autoinstall.md))

### Speech isn't working
1. Check that speakers/headphones are connected
2. Check volume settings using parent escape
3. Verify the TTS engine is installed (see [dev.md](dev.md))

### The screen looks weird
Purple Computer expects a modern display. Try adjusting resolution using the parent escape menu.

## Getting More Help

- Read [autoinstall.md](autoinstall.md) for installation help
- File an issue on GitHub if you find a bug

## What Makes This Different

Purple Computer is text-based and command-driven. Your child:
- Types commands instead of tapping apps
- Creates patterns and explores logic
- Works offline with no internet connection

No subscriptions, no tracking, no app store. Runs on old hardware.

## Technical Details

Purple Computer:
- Boots directly into a fullscreen terminal
- No desktop environment
- Auto-login as a dedicated user
- Offline by default
- Parent escape: Ctrl+Alt+P
